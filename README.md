## Rock Paper Scissors

# Instructions

A rock, paper, scissors game. 

Inside the `main.py` file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. This will make it easy to print them out to the console. 

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

You can find the "official" rules of the game on [the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/)
